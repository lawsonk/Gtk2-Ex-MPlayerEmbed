=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::MPlayerEmbed - a widget to embed the MPlayer media player into GTK+ applications

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Gtk2::Ex::MPlayerEmbed;

	my $window = Gtk2::Window->new;

	my $embed = Gtk2::MPlayerEmbed->new;

	$window->add($embed);

	$window->show_all;

	$embed->play("movie.mpg");

	Gtk2->main;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Gtk2::Ex::MPlayerEmbed allows you to embed a video player into your
applications. It uses the XEMBED system to allow the I<mplayer> program
to insert its window into your application.

=head1 OBJECT HIERARCHY

       +----Gtk2::Widget

=head1 PROPERTIES

The following properties are accessible through the standard Glib C<get()> and C<set()> methods:

=over


=item C<mplayer_path>

This is the path to the I<mplayer> program. This is C</usr/bin/mplayer> by default.

=item C<args>

This is a string containing the command line arguments passed to I<mplayer> (no
default).

=item C<loaded>

This is a B<boolean> value that indicates whether the I<mplayer> program is
currently running.

=item C<state>

This is an B<enumeration> (described by C<Gtk2::Ex::MPlayerEmbed::PlayingState>)
that indicates the state of the player. C<state> may be one of: C<stopped>,
C<playing>, C<paused>. It is C<stopped> at startup.

=head1 METHODS

	$embed->play([$content]);

This method has two behaviours: if the the C<loaded> property is true (a video
stream has been loaded), and the C<state> property is C<paused>, then it will
resume playing the stream. If C<loaded> is true but the stream is B<not>
paused, then the method will carp() and return undef.

If C<load> is false, and the C<$content> argument is defined, then the player
will attempt to load and play the stream identified by C<$content>, which may
be a path to a file, the URL of a network resource, or a "meta-URI" such as
C<dvd://> or C<dvb://>.

=cut

sub play {
	my ($self, $file) = @_;
	if ($self->get('loaded') && $self->get('state') ne 'stopped') {
		if ($self->get('state') eq 'playing') {
			carp("Can't play while still playing, use stop() first.");
			return undef;

		} else {
			return $self->resume;

		}

	} else {
		my $cmd = sprintf(
			'|%s -slave -vf screenshot -wid %d -geometry %dx%d %s "%s" 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null',
			$self->get('mplayer_path'),
			$self->get_id,
			$self->allocation->width,
			$self->allocation->height,
			$self->get('args'),
			$file
		);
		if (!$self->slave->open($cmd)) {
			croak("Cannot open '$cmd': $!");
			return undef;

		} else {
			$self->set('loaded',	1);
			$self->set('state',	'playing');
			return 1;

		}
	}
}

=pod

	$embed->pause;

This method will pause the current video stream. If the stream is not playing,
this method will carp() and return undef.

=cut

sub pause {
	my $self = shift;
	if (!$self->get('loaded') || $self->get('state') eq 'stopped') {
		carp("Player must be loaded and playing before it can pause/resume.");
		return undef;

	} else {
		$self->set('state', 'paused');
		return $self->tell_slave(PAUSE);

	}
}

=pod

	$embed->resume;

This is just a convenience wrapper around C<pause()>. The C<pause()> method is
really a toggle, and two subsequent calls to C<pause()> will pause and then
resume the stream, so this method exists to disambiguate.

=cut

sub resume { $_[0]->pause }

=pod

	$embed->stop;

This method tells I<mplayer> to quit, and resets the widget's internal state.
Before loading another video stream with C<play()>, use this method first.

=cut

sub stop {
	my $self = shift;
	if (!$self->get('loaded') || $self->get('state') eq 'stopped') {
		carp("Can't stop an unloaded or stopped stream.");

	} else {
		$self->tell_slave(CLOSE);
		$self->slave->close;
		$self->{slave} = FileHandle->new;
		$self->set('loaded', undef);
		$self->set('state', 'stopped');

	}
}

=pod

        $embed->screenshot;

This method will take a screenshot of video stream. If the stream is not playing,
this method will carp() and return undef. Files named 'shotNNNN.png' will be 
saved in the working directory, using the first available number - no  files  will 
be  overwritten.

=cut

sub screenshot {
        my $self = shift;
        if (!$self->get('loaded') || $self->get('state') eq 'stopped') {
                carp("Player must be loaded and playing before you can take a screenshot.");
                return undef;

        } else {
                return $self->tell_slave(SS);
        }
}

=pod

	$embed->tell_slave($something);

This method sends a command to the I<mplayer> slave process. The available
commands are documented in the mplayer-slave-spec.txt file in the source
distribution.

=cut

sub tell_slave {
	my ($self, $msg) = @_;
	$self->slave->autoflush(1);
	return $self->slave->print("$msg\n");
}

sub slave {
	return $_[0]->{slave};

=head1 PREREQUISITES

=over

=item L<Gtk2>

=item The I<mplayer> program, available from L<http://www.mplayerhq.hu/>.

=back

=head1 TODO

1. Do something about controlling aspect ration. We need a way to get the
aspect ratio of the video stream, and use a L<Gtk2::AspectFrame> to constrain
the shape of the widget.

2. Implement more convenience wrappers around the mplayer command set.

2. Implement a C<stream_ended> signal that watches the I<mplayer> process and
emits when it quits.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<GStreamer>, for a much more powerful, general purpose multimedia system
that's compatible with GTK+.
